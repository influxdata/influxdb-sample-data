# InfluxDB Sample Datasets

This repository contains sample time series data used to test InfluxDB.

## Why sample data

Running benchmarks with synthetic tests often does not reflect real-world use. This repo is meant to be a collection of "real-world" time series datasets so testing can model more usage scenarios.

## Data format

This is the original JSON sample data imported and a backup/snapshot created. Instructions here: https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/administration/backup_and_restore.html
